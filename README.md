# Weather App

This app allows users to view the current weather and air quality index (AQI) in their current location. It uses the JavaScript `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method to get the user's current location, then uses the latitude and longitude coordinates obtained to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The data is then displayed on the page.
